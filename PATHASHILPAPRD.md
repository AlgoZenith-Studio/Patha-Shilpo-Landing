# PATHASHILPA — PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

**Version** 1.0 · MVP **Problem Statement** AI-Driven Market Linkage and Smart Cataloging Mobile Application for Marginalized Artisans **Category** Software · Smart India Hackathon 2026

# PART A — THE PRODUCT

## 1 · SUMMARY

Pathashilpa converts **a photograph and a spoken sentence** into a complete, priced, published product listing for a rural Indian artisan.

The artisan performs three actions: photograph the product, speak about it, confirm. The system removes the background, writes the title, description and tags in English and Hindi, calculates a fair price with its reasoning, and publishes to a public storefront — working fully offline and upgrading silently when the network returns.

**Positioning:** Not another marketplace. The layer that *creates* the listing other marketplaces require.

**Tagline:** Your craft. Your price. Your name.

---

## 2 · THE PROBLEM

### 2.1 Statement

A marketplace listing requires four artefacts: **a clean photograph, English product copy, a defensible price, and completed registration forms.** Rural artisans can produce none of them. Every existing platform — Amazon Karigar, Flipkart Samarth, ONDC, IndiaHandmade — begins *after* those four exist. The artisan reaches "Create Listing" and stops.

### 2.2 Evidence *(only these figures may be used in any material)*

| Figure | Meaning | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **0.2%** | share of handloom sales occurring online | 4th All India Handloom Census, via India Development Review |
| **95.5%** | rural mobile owners who own a smartphone | NSO, Comprehensive Modular Survey: Telecom, 2025 |
| **67%** | handloom households earning under ₹5,000/month | PIB, Ministry of Textiles |
| **≈ ₹270/day** | average handicraft artisan earnings | IHD & Crafts Council of India |
| **\~20% / \>90%** | artisans with digital-selling training / who want it | Digital Empowerment Foundation, via IDR |
| **35.2 lakh** | handloom weavers \+ allied workers | PIB, Ministry of Textiles |
| **7,104 → 5,134** | mn sq m handloom output, 2013-14 → 2017-18 | Economic & Political Weekly |

### 2.3 The insight

**0.2% online against 95.5% smartphone ownership.** The device barrier is already gone. What is missing is software the artisan can operate.

### 2.4 Deliberately excluded

No credible government or peer-reviewed source exists for *middleman margin share* or *counterfeit handloom volume*. Both are referenced qualitatively only, never as statistics.

---

## 3 · USERS

### 3.1 Primary — the artisan

**Kamala, 42, Chanderi, Madhya Pradesh.** Weaves silk sarees; takes two weeks per piece. Owns a ₹7,000 Android phone, uses WhatsApp voice notes daily, does not type. Speaks Hindi and Bundeli; reads Hindi slowly, no English. Sells to a trader who visits monthly, and at two melas a year. Network drops for hours at a time.

**What she needs:** to sell without learning anything, without typing, and without waiting for the trader. **What blocks her today:** she cannot photograph, describe, price or register.

### 3.2 Secondary — the buyer

**Retail buyer** — wants authenticity and the maker's story. **B2B buyer / exporter** — wants bulk quantity, consistent quality, verified provenance, direct contact. **Institutional buyer** — procures through GeM, needs GI verification and compliance.

### 3.3 Supporting

**Moderator** — verifies artisans, removes counterfeit listings. **Department / NGO** — onboards clusters, monitors cluster income and output.

---

## 4 · VALUE PROPOSITION

| Actor | Before | With Pathashilpa |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Artisan | Cannot create a listing at all | A live listing in \~90 seconds, by speaking |
| Artisan | Prices by guesswork, undersells | Cost floor \+ explained market band |
| Artisan | Anonymous product on a shelf | Face, story, cluster and GI tag on every listing |
| Artisan | Capital locked in unsold stock | Produces only against confirmed orders |
| Buyer | Cannot verify what is handmade | Provenance block tied to verified identity |
| Department | Annual paper returns | Live cluster output and income data |

### The five differentiators

1. **Offline-first AI** — a complete listing with zero internet  
2. **Voice-only workflow** — no typing at any step  
3. **Explained pricing** — shows *why*, not just the number  
4. **Story as listing data** — maker and GI tag travel with every product  
5. **One record, all channels** — storefront, GeM and ONDC together

---

## 5 · SCOPE

### 5.1 MVP — must ship

- Phone OTP authentication with role selection (artisan / buyer)  
- Artisan: voice-guided onboarding, profile, product list, **four-step add-product flow**  
- AI: image quality check \+ crop/pad, speech-to-text, listing generation (EN \+ HI), price calculation  
- **Offline draft creation \+ sync engine with silent upgrade**  
- Buyer: browse, filter, product detail, artisan storefront, enquiry, RFQ form  
- Firestore Security Rules enforcing RBAC  
- Public marketing website with policies

### 5.2 Mocked, and labelled as mocked

- GeM / ONDC publishing → status chip only  
- KYC verification → document upload without verification  
- Payments → "Enquire" instead of "Buy"  
- Moderator and department screens → stubs behind real rules

### 5.3 Roadmap, not MVP

Credit scoring from sales history · export enablement (HS codes, IEC) · cluster co-operative pooled fulfilment · all 22 Bhashini languages · department dashboards · ML pricing trained on realised sales

### 5.4 Explicit non-goals

Not a logistics company. Not a payment aggregator. Not a competitor to ONDC — a participant in it. Not a training programme.

---

## 6 · KEY USER JOURNEY — the add-product flow

**Step 1 · Photo** — camera opens, artisan shoots, device checks blur and brightness, shows preview with retake option. **Step 2 · Voice** — large mic button, artisan speaks in Hindi, live transcript appears. **Step 3 · Costs** — two large numeric inputs: material cost, hours of work. **Step 4 · Review** — cleaned image, generated title/description/tags, price band with reasoning read aloud. One button: Publish.

**Offline behaviour:** steps 1–4 complete with no network. The listing is marked *Offline Draft* and is already sellable. On reconnect it syncs, the image is re-rendered, the copy is upgraded — **and the price does not change.**

---

## 7 · FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

**Auth & RBAC** — phone OTP; one-time role selection; role stored as Auth custom claim, mirrored in Firestore and locally; Security Rules are the authoritative enforcement layer.

**Artisan module** — profile CRUD (own only); product CRUD (own only); enquiry accept/decline; offline draft creation; sync status visibility.

**Buyer module** — read live products; filter by craft, state, price; view artisan storefront; create enquiry and RFQ; own profile with buyer type and GSTIN.

**AI services** — each pipeline is an abstract interface with an online and an offline implementation plus a router that selects by connectivity. The UI never knows which ran.

**Sync engine** — client-generated `localId` for idempotency; FIFO queue; exponential backoff; server-wins conflict rule; payload target under 400 KB per product.

**Pricing** — `floor = (materialCost + hours × ₹150) × 1.15`; `suggested = round(floor × 1.25, ₹50)`; `max = round(suggested × 1.3, ₹50)`. Identical online and offline. The artisan may always override.

---

## 8 · NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

| Area | Requirement |
| :---- | :---- |
| Device | Android 8+, 2 GB RAM, ₹6,000 handset class |
| Offline | Full add-product flow functional with no network |
| Payload | ≤ 400 KB per product sync |
| Accessibility | ≥ 16px text, ≥ 56px tap targets, icon beside every label |
| Language | English \+ Hindi complete; Bengali partial |
| Privacy | Voice recordings deletable by the artisan; DPDP Act 2023 aligned |
| Data ownership | Artisan can export or delete all their data |

---

## 9 · SUCCESS METRICS

**Primary:** listing completion rate — % of artisans who start the add-product flow and publish. Target **\> 80%**, against a manual-marketplace baseline near zero.

**Supporting:** time to first listing (target \< 3 minutes) · listings created offline (proves the thesis) · artisan retention at 30 days · enquiries per listing · realised price vs cost floor.

---

## 10 · BUSINESS MODEL

- **Revenue** — commission on B2B orders; paid RFQ access for exporters and institutional buyers  
- **The artisan pays nothing**, ever, and gives up no margin  
- **Operating cost** — Bhashini, ONDC and GeM are free public infrastructure; one AI call per listing, not per view  
- **Distribution** — Development Commissioners, NGOs and co-operatives are already funded to reach these clusters; acquisition cost is zero  
- **Defensibility** — realised artisan sale prices compound into a pricing dataset no competitor can buy

---

## 11 · RISKS

| Risk | Mitigation |
| :---- | :---- |
| Artisan distrusts an AI price | Reasoning read aloud; artisan can override; cost floor blocks loss-making sales |
| Weak network, low-end devices | Offline-first; ≤ 400 KB syncs; self-resuming retries |
| No sales history to price against | Deterministic cost floor from day one; seed medians from public listings; retrain on realised sales |
| Sellers without buyers | Publish into GeM and ONDC where buyers already are; onboard buyers before mass artisan onboarding |
| Speech fails on dialects | Bhashini → device ASR → record-and-form fallback; raw audio always retained |
| Counterfeit listings | Provenance block tied to verified identity; perceptual-hash duplicate detection; moderator takedown |
